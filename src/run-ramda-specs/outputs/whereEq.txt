  whereEq
    ✓ returns true if the test object satisfies the spec
    ✓ does not need the spec and the test object to have the same interface (the test object will have a superset of the specs properties)
    ✓ matches specs that have undefined properties
    ✓ is true for an empty spec
    1) reports true when the object equals the spec
    ✓ matches inherited props
    2) does not match inherited spec
