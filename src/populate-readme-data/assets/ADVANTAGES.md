### Typescript included

Typescript definitions are included in the library, in comparison to **Ramda**, where you need to additionally install `@types/ramda`.

Still, you need to be aware that functional programming features in `Typescript` are in development, which means that using **R.compose/R.pipe** can be problematic.

#### Immutable TS definitions

You can use immutable version of Rambda definitions, which is linted with ESLint `functional/prefer-readonly-type` plugin.

```
import {add} from 'rambda/immutable'
```

### Deno support

While `Ramda` is available for `Deno` users, `Rambda` provides you with included TS definitions:

```
import * as R from "https://x.nest.land/rambda@7.1.0/mod.ts";
import * as Ramda from "https://x.nest.land/ramda@0.28.0/mod.ts";

R.add(1)('foo') // => will trigger warning in VSCode
Ramda.add(1)('foo') // => will not trigger warning in VSCode
```

### Dot notation for `R.path`, `R.paths`, `R.assocPath` and `R.lensPath`

Standard usage of `R.path` is `R.path(['a', 'b'], {a: {b: 1} })`.

In **Rambda** you have the choice to use dot notation(which is arguably more readable):

```
R.path('a.b', {a: {b: 1} })
```

### Comma notation for `R.pick` and `R.omit`

Similar to dot notation, but the separator is comma(`,`) instead of dot(`.`).

```
R.pick('a,b', {a: 1 , b: 2, c: 3} })
// No space allowed between properties
```

### Speed

**Rambda** is generally more performant than `Ramda` as the [benchmarks](#-benchmarks) can prove that.

### Support

As the library is smaller than Ramda, issues are much faster resolved.

Closing the issue is usually accompanied by publishing a new patch version of `Rambda` to NPM.
